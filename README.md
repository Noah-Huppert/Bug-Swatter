[B]Summary:[/B]
Bug Swatter is a chrome extension that makes sorting through duplicates on the [URL='http://pa.lennardf1989.com/Tracker/']Bug Tracker[/URL] easier.

[B]What problems does it solve?[/B]
If you have spent any time sorting through bugs you will know that there are a lot of duplicates, because of this you have to request closure on a lot of bugs. Bug Swatter allows you to mark certain bugs as:
[LIST]
[*]Clear - No duplicates
[*]Marked as duplicate - Marked so you don't keep almost resubmitted the duplicate report.
[*]Bookmarked - Marked so you can go back to this bug at any time, for repeat offenders.
[/LIST]
This allows you to spend more time dealing with bugs you haven't verified.
